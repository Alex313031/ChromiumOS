# ChromiumOS
ChromiumOS builds with x264 and linux firmware.

Inspired and based on ArnoldTheBats builds which can be downloaded here > https://arnoldthebat.co.uk/wordpress/

Source code from Arnold (ChromiumOS overlay) https://github.com/arnoldthebat/chromiumos - if you don't know what this is I invite you to learn, but for beginners one can just download the premade image in releases.
